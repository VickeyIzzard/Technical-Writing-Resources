## PTW Acronyms
<img align="right" src="./assets/images/Acronym-Blocks.jpg" width="40%" alt="A group of wooden blocks with black letters that spell the word acronym." title="A group of wooden blocks with black letters that spell the word acronym.">

Professional technical writing ([PTW](./assets/ptw-acronym-list.csv#L44)) and technical communications ([TC](./assets/ptw-acronym-list.csv#L60)) involve highly specialized vocabulary. This resource aims to make acronyms related to PTW and TC more accessible to program students and others.

*[The Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/)* defines an acronym[^1] as "a word (such as NATO, radar, or laser) formed from the initial letter or letters of each of the successive parts or major parts of a compound term or an abbreviation[^2] (such as FBI) formed from initial letters, known as an initialism[^3]."
- An **abbreviation** is a truncated word (such as [TTY](./assets/ptw-acronym-list.csv#L63)).
- An **acronym** comprises parts of the phrase it stands for and is pronounced as a word (such as [ARM](./assets/ptw-acronym-list.csv#L5), [DITA](./assets/ptw-acronym-list.csv#L13), [ISO](./assets/ptw-acronym-list.csv#L27), [SAAS](./assets/ptw-acronym-list.csv#L50), etc.).
- An **initialism** is an acronym pronounced as individual letters (such as [PTW](./assets/ptw-acronym-list.csv#L44) and [STC](./assets/ptw-acronym-list.csv#L57)).
- A **numeronym**[^4] is a number-based word with a number to form an abbreviation or a word with the letters between the first and the last letter replaced by a number that represents the number of letters omitted (such as [L10N](./assets/ptw-acronym-list.csv#L33) for localization).

### Acronym List
To access the list, go to [PTW Acronyms](./assets/ptw-acronym-list.csv). The CSV file [renders as an interactive table](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/working-with-non-code-files#rendering-csv-and-tsv-data)[^5] with a search function.

> **Note:**
> This list is a compilation of acronyms to support student learning related to the 2023 summer cohort of the [PTW certificate at the University of Washington (UW) Professional & Continuing Education (UWCPE, UWC²)](https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/professional-technical-writing).
> - It is **not inclusive** of every word or phrase within this program.
> - General definitions are provided for **reference only**.
> - To scroll the columns in the table, navigate to the bottom of the table, then use the scroll bar.
