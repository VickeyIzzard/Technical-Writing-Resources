Professional technical writing (PTW) and technical communications (TC) involve highly specialized vocabulary. This resource aims to make acronyms related to PTW and TC more accessible to program students and others.

*[The Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/)* defines an acronym[^1] as “a word (such as NATO, radar, or laser) formed from the initial letter or letters of each of the successive parts or major parts of a compound term or an abbreviation[^2] (such as FBI) formed from initial letters, known as an initialism[^3].”
- An **abbreviation** is a truncated word (such as TTY).
- An **acronym** comprises parts of the phrase it stands for and is pronounced as a word (such as ARM, DITA, ISO, SAAS, etc.).
- An **initialism** is an acronym pronounced as individual letters (such as PTW and STC).
- A **numeronym**[^4] is a number-based word with a number to form an abbreviation or a word with the letters between the first and the last letter replaced by a number that represents the number of letters omitted (such as L10N for localization).
