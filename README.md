### About Acronyms
*[The Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/)* defines an [acronym](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acronym) as "a word (such as NATO, radar, or laser) formed from the initial letter or letters of each of the successive parts or major parts of a compound term or an [abbreviation](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/abbreviation) (such as FBI) formed from initial letters, known as an [initialism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/initialism)."

More about acronyms:
- An **abbreviation** is a truncated word (such as TTY).
- An **acronym** comprises parts of the phrase it stands for and is pronounced as a word (such as ARM, DITA, ISO, SAAS, etc.).
- An **initialism** is an acronym pronounced as individual letters (such as PTW and STC).
- A [**numeronym**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym) is a number-based word with a number to form an abbreviation or a word with the letters between the first and the last letter replaced by a number that represents the number of letters omitted (such as L10N for localization).
